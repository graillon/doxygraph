Doxygraph is a collection of tools to automate reverse engineering UML class diagrams from your project's source code, and present them as interactive web apps.

It relies on Doxygen to parse your source code and create an intermediate XML representation of the information it collects, so it supports all the same programming languages that Doxygen supports: C, C++, C#, Objective C, Java, Python, PHP, Tcl, D, IDL, VHDL, and Fortran.

It is intended to facilitate communication within and between development teams; it does not aim to support round trip engineering.
